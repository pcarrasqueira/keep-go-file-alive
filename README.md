## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

The GitHub Action has been optimized for faster execution:

- **Reduced Runtime**: Uses Alpine Linux container with pre-installed Chromium (~60% faster)
- **No Browser Downloads**: System Chromium eliminates Playwright installation time
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Tests moved to separate workflow, production runs only essential steps
- **Smaller Timeout**: Reduced overall workflow timeout from 30 to 15 minutes

**Before**: ~5-8 minutes per run  
**After**: ~2-3 minutes per run

## ü•∑ Stealth Technology

The tool employs sophisticated anti-detection measures:

### Header Management
- **Dynamic User Agents**: Rotates between 16+ real browser user agents (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Realistic Headers**: Includes proper Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, and sec-ch-ua headers
- **Browser-Specific**: Matches headers to the selected user agent for authenticity
- **Session Consistency**: Maintains the same headers throughout a session for natural behavior

### Browser Stealth
- **Automation Hiding**: Removes `navigator.webdriver` property
- **Fingerprint Randomization**: Random viewport sizes from common screen resolutions
- **Efficient Resource Blocking**: Blocks images, stylesheets, fonts, and media for better performance and stability
- **Minimal Overhead**: Streamlined browser setup for maximum stability

### Behavioral Simulation  
- **Human Timing**: Random delays (2-7 seconds) between URL processing
- **Natural Interactions**: Simulates simple scrolling for realistic behavior
- **Realistic Navigation**: Waits for network idle before interacting with elements
- **Organic Clicking**: Small delays before clicking (200-500ms)

## üîß Development

### Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keep-file-alive.yml     # Optimized production workflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ping-gofile.js         # Main application logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ headers.js             # Anti-detection headers management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json            # Configuration and stealth settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # Dependencies and scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This file
```

### Testing Locally

For testing without triggering actual pings, you can use test URLs:

```bash
export GOFILE_URLS="https://example.com/test1"
export VERBOSE=true
npm start
```

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (without Playwright browsers)
npm install --ignore-scripts

# For local browser testing, install Playwright browsers manually
# (Only needed if not using system Chromium)
npx playwright install chromium

# Validate setup
npm run validate
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **URL Parsing**: Parses and validates URLs from the `GOFILE_URLS` environment variable
2. **Stealth Browser Launch**: Starts a Chromium browser with anti-detection features and realistic configuration
3. **Page Navigation**: Visits each GoFile URL using randomized headers and lightweight navigation (domcontentloaded)
4. **Link Detection** (Enhanced): 
   - Waits 5 seconds for JavaScript-heavy GoFile pages to fully render
   - Monitors network traffic for download URLs
   - Searches for download buttons using 14+ different selectors
   - Checks element visibility before interaction
   - Extracts all GoFile-related links from page content
   - Simulates simple scrolling for realistic behavior
   - Clicks visible download buttons to reveal direct download links
5. **Sample Download**: Downloads the first 1MB of each detected download link using rotating headers to keep them active
6. **Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics and logs

## üîí Anti-Detection Features

The tool includes advanced stealth capabilities to avoid automation detection:

- **Dynamic Headers**: Rotates between realistic headers from popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Randomizes viewport sizes and user agents
- **Human Behavior**: Simulates natural scrolling and interaction timing patterns  
- **Smart Delays**: Adds random delays between operations to mimic human timing
- **Resource Management**: Blocks images, stylesheets, fonts, and media to improve performance and stability
- **Automation Hiding**: Removes webdriver property

## üîí Security & Privacy

- Uses official Playwright browser automation with advanced anti-detection features
- Downloads only 1MB samples from detected download links to verify accessibility
- Downloaded data is immediately discarded, nothing is stored permanently
- All communication uses standard HTTPS with realistic browser headers
- Mimics human behavior patterns to avoid triggering security systems

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No URLs found in GOFILE_URLS"**
- Check that the variable is properly set in your repository settings (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables)
- Ensure URLs are separated by newlines, not spaces or commas

**"No download links detected"**
- The GoFile page structure may have changed
- Enable verbose logging to see detailed debug information
- Try manually opening the URL to verify it's accessible

**"Ping failed: 403 Forbidden"**
- The download links may have expired despite our efforts
- The tool now includes anti-detection features that should reduce this error
- Try running the action more frequently
- Check if the original GoFile links are still valid

**"ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES"**
- This error indicates the browser ran out of memory during navigation
- The tool now uses lightweight navigation (domcontentloaded) to reduce memory usage
- Resource blocking is enabled to minimize memory consumption
- If this persists, the GoFile page may be loading too many resources

**Workflow timeouts**
- Increase the timeout in the workflow file if processing many URLs
- The tool now includes random delays for stealth, which may increase runtime
- Consider splitting large URL lists into smaller batches

**"Browser detection issues"**
- The tool includes comprehensive stealth features to avoid detection
- Headers are automatically randomized with each run
- Human behavior simulation helps bypass automated checks
- Enable verbose logging to see which headers are being used

### Getting Help

1. Enable verbose logging by setting `VERBOSE=true` 
2. Check the workflow logs in the Actions tab
3. Look for specific error messages in the summary section
